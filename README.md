# Chatter

https://chatter.zhongchileoli.vercel.app/

A real-time chat application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Sign up your own dummy account, or log in with the credentials below to use the chat app:
* Email: demo@gmail.com
* Password: demodemo

## Built with

* React
* Firebase
* [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## This application gives users the ability to:

* Change profile pictures
* Send/receive chat messages and images
* Create new chat rooms
* Edit chat room names
* Add new members to chat rooms
* Remove existing members from chat rooms
* Leave/delete chat rooms

## Things I learned:

* How to make functional components auto re-render using **State and Effect Hooks**
* How to share values between components without passing props using **Context**
* How to handle form validations and error messages using **Formik** and **Yup**

## Next steps:

* Add typing indicator for when users are currently typing in the chat
* Add active/inactive status indicators to users' avatars
* Allow admins to assign other chat members as admins
